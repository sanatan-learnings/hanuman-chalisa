# OpenAI API Configuration
#
# This file is a template. To use it:
# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Get your OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
#    - Sign up or log in to OpenAI
#    - Go to "API keys" in the left sidebar
#    - Click "Create new secret key"
#    - Copy the key (starts with sk-proj-...)
# 3. Paste your key below (replace the placeholder)
# 4. Add credits to your OpenAI account: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
#
# Usage:
# - Embedding generation: Used by scripts/generate_embeddings.py
# - Cloudflare Worker: Stored as secret in Cloudflare (see docs/cloudflare-worker-setup.md)
#
# Security:
# - NEVER commit .env to git (it's in .gitignore)
# - Keep your API key secret
# - Rotate keys if accidentally exposed
