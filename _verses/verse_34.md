interpretive_meaning: "This verse promises both a good death and a good rebirth. Going to "Raghubar pur" at death means liberation or at least going to a divine realm. If rebirth occurs, it's as a "Haribhakt" - meaning devotion carries forward across lives. This teaches that spiritual progress is never lost; devotion creates a positive spiral across births."

story: "The moment of death is considered crucial in Hindu philosophy - one's final thoughts determine the next birth. This verse assures that Hanuman devotees will have auspicious deaths, their consciousness directed toward the divine. Even if complete liberation isn't achieved, they'll be reborn with devotional tendencies, continuing their spiritual journey."

practical_application:
  teaching: "Devotion to Hanuman ensures an auspicious death and spiritual progress that carries forward across lifetimes."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when contemplating mortality or when you want assurance that your spiritual efforts create lasting benefits beyond this life."
