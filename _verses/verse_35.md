literal_translation: "One need not keep other deities in mind; serving Hanuman alone creates all happiness."

interpretive_meaning: "This verse appears to advocate exclusive devotion to Hanuman, but it's actually saying that Hanuman worship is sufficient - one needn't worry about appeasing multiple deities. This reflects the Bhakti tradition where single-pointed devotion to one form of the divine is considered complete. It simplifies spiritual practice and deepens focus."

story: "In Hinduism's vast pantheon, people often worry about worshiping the "right" deity or offending others by not worshiping them. This verse liberates devotees from such anxiety. Since Hanuman himself is devoted only to Rama, worshiping Hanuman automatically connects one to Rama and the entire divine hierarchy. It's not exclusionary but rather an efficient, focused path."

practical_application:
  teaching: "Single-pointed devotion to Hanuman is sufficient for complete spiritual fulfillment - there's no need to fragment your devotion across multiple deities."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when feeling overwhelmed by religious complexity, remembering that focused devotion to Hanuman encompasses all divine blessings."
