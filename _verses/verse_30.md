literal_translation: "You are the protector of saints and sages, destroyer of demons, and Rama's beloved."

interpretive_meaning: "This verse captures Hanuman's dual role - nurturing protector of the good, fierce destroyer of evil. "Ram dulare" (Rama's beloved) explains why he can perform both functions - his actions flow from divine love, not personal preference. This teaches that protection of the righteous necessarily includes opposition to the wicked."

story: "Throughout the Ramayana, Hanuman protected sages suffering from demon attacks. He destroyed demons terrorizing the forests and later led armies against Ravana's forces. Yet his fierceness toward evil never diminished his gentleness toward devotees. This perfect balance of compassion and strength makes him an ideal protector deity."

practical_application:
  teaching: "True spiritual strength means being a gentle protector of the good while being fierce in opposing evil - both flow from divine love."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when you need to protect what is righteous or when facing opposition from negative forces, drawing strength from Hanuman's dual nature."
