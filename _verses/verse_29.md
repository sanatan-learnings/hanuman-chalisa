literal_translation: "Your glory is renowned throughout the four ages and illuminates the world."

interpretive_meaning: "The four yugas (Satya, Treta, Dwapara, Kali) represent all of time in Hindu cosmology. Hanuman's glory transcending all ages means his relevance is eternal, not limited to the Treta Yuga when Ramayana occurred. As "jagat ujiyara" (world's light), he guides humanity across time. This promises that Hanuman's protection is available in every era, including our current Kali Yuga."

story: "Hanuman is "chiranjeevi" (immortal), blessed to live through all yugas. He witnessed Rama's incarnation in Treta Yuga, met the Pandavas (especially Bhima, his brother) in Dwapara Yuga, and is believed to be present in Kali Yuga wherever Rama's name is chanted or the Ramayana is recited. This eternal presence makes him uniquely accessible as a deity."

practical_application:
  teaching: "Hanuman's glory and protection transcend time - his grace is eternally available across all ages and in all circumstances."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse to remember that Hanuman's presence and blessings are timeless and ever-available, regardless of the era or circumstances."
