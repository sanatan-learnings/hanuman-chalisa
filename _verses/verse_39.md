literal_translation: "One who recites this Hanuman Chalisa attains accomplishment/success, with Lord Shiva as witness."

interpretive_meaning: ""Siddhi" can mean both worldly success and spiritual powers. Invoking Shiva as witness is significant - Shiva is Hanuman's deity (Hanuman is considered Shiva's avatar) and the ultimate truth-knower. Having Shiva as witness means this promise is divinely guaranteed. This verse validates the entire Chalisa as a powerful spiritual tool."

story: "Shiva and Hanuman have a special connection - Hanuman is believed to be an avatar of Shiva himself, taken to serve Rama. Shiva's witnessing means the highest divine authority validates this text's power. Tulsidas, by invoking Shiva, places the Chalisa within the broader Hindu spiritual framework, showing how devotion to Hanuman connects to universal divine principles."

practical_application:
  teaching: "Reciting the Hanuman Chalisa leads to both worldly success and spiritual accomplishment, validated by the highest divine authority."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse to affirm your faith in the Chalisa's power, knowing that its effectiveness is witnessed and guaranteed by Lord Shiva himself."
