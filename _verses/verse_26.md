interpretive_meaning: "This verse specifies the quality of devotion needed - "man kram bachan" means thoughts, actions, and words must align. Surface-level devotion isn't enough; one must think of Hanuman, act according to dharma, and speak his name. This threefold integration creates genuine connection. The promise is freedom from "sankat" - all forms of crisis."

story: "Hanuman is called "Sankat Mochan" (liberator from crises) in temples across India. Countless stories tell of devotees being saved from impossible situations through Hanuman's grace. The key teaching is that devotion must be holistic - our thoughts, actions, and words must all be aligned with our faith for it to be effective."

practical_application:
  teaching: "True devotion requires alignment of thought, action, and speech - when these three are unified in Hanuman's remembrance, liberation from all crises follows."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when in crisis, ensuring your thoughts, actions, and words all reflect devotion and alignment with dharma."
