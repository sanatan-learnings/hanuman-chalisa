interpretive_meaning: "This verse establishes that Hanuman is praised across all categories of celestial beings - the eternally young sages (Kumaras), creator god (Brahma), divine messenger (Narada), goddess of wisdom (Saraswati), and the cosmic serpent (Shesha). This universal acclaim shows that Hanuman transcends sectarian boundaries."

story: "The four Kumaras (Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana, and Sanatkumara) are mind-born sons of Brahma who remained eternally young and celibate, representing pure wisdom. Narada is the traveling sage who spreads devotion. Saraswati is the goddess of learning. That all these exalted beings praise Hanuman indicates his unique position - he combines wisdom, devotion, celibacy, and service in perfect harmony."

  teaching: "True spiritual excellence is recognized and celebrated universally across all divine hierarchies and traditions."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when you need to remember that genuine devotion and virtue transcend sectarian boundaries and earn universal respect."
