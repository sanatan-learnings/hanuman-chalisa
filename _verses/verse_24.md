interpretive_meaning: "This verse addresses protection from negative forces - both external (evil spirits) and internal (negative thoughts, fears). The mere utterance of Hanuman's name creates a protective shield. It teaches that divine names carry power and that faith itself is protective. The verse is popular for overcoming fear, especially fear of the unknown."

story: "Hanuman is particularly invoked for protection against evil forces and negative energies. His fierce form and absolute dedication to dharma make him the destroyer of all negativity. Many devotees recite Hanuman Chalisa at night or during difficult times specifically for this protective quality. The tradition holds that spaces where Hanuman's name is chanted remain free from negative influences."

practical_application:
  teaching: "Chanting Hanuman's name creates a protective shield against all negative forces - external threats and internal fears alike."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when experiencing fear of the dark, negative energies, or when you need protection from harmful influences."
