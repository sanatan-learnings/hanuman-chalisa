literal_translation: "And whatever desire anyone harbors, that person obtains unlimited fruits of life."

interpretive_meaning: "This verse extends Hanuman's blessings beyond crisis-resolution to wish-fulfillment. "Amit jivan phal" (unlimited life fruits) suggests both material and spiritual benefits. However, implicit in this is the understanding that desires should be righteous. Hanuman grants wishes that align with dharma and one's spiritual evolution."

story: "Hanuman is known as a "kaamdhenu" (wish-fulfilling cow) among devotees - he fulfills sincere desires. However, his blessings always come with spiritual growth. Stories tell of devotees receiving what they needed (which might differ from what they initially wanted) in ways that advanced their spiritual journey. The verse teaches that divine grace gives us what truly benefits us."

practical_application:
  teaching: "Righteous desires offered to Hanuman are fulfilled abundantly, leading to both material and spiritual fruits."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when you have sincere, righteous desires that you wish to manifest, trusting that divine grace will fulfill what truly benefits you."
