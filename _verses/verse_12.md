literal_translation: "The Lord of the Raghu dynasty praised you greatly, saying "You are as dear to me as my brother Bharata.""

interpretive_meaning: "For Rama to compare Hanuman to Bharata is the highest praise possible. Bharata was Rama's brother who exemplified ideal devotion, refusing the throne and ruling only as Rama's regent for 14 years. This comparison elevates Hanuman to the status of family, showing that devotion creates a bond stronger than blood."

story: "Rama rarely praised anyone so openly, making this statement especially significant. Bharata had placed Rama's sandals on the throne and ruled in his name, refusing to sit on the throne himself. Similarly, Hanuman never acted for himself but always as Rama's representative. The comparison acknowledges that both embodied perfect devotion and selfless service."

practical_application:
  teaching: "Selfless devotion and service create bonds stronger than blood relationships and earn the highest recognition."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when you need to remember that devoted service makes you family to the divine, transcending all worldly relationships."
