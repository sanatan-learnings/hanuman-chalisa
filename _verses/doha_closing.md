literal_translation: "O son of the wind, remover of crises, of auspicious form! Along with Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita, please dwell in my heart, O king of gods."

interpretive_meaning: "This closing prayer asks Hanuman to reside in the devotee's heart along with Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita - the complete divine family. "Mangal murti" (auspicious form) means Hanuman's very presence brings auspiciousness. The request is comprehensive - not just for Hanuman's protection but for the entire divine family to permanently reside within, transforming the heart into a sacred space."

story: "This doha beautifully concludes the Chalisa by bringing together all the key figures. Hanuman, who always carries Rama in his heart, is asked to bring the entire divine family into the devotee's heart as well. This creates a nested devotion - by welcoming Hanuman, one welcomes Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana too. The heart becomes a temple, and life becomes worship."

practical_application:
  teaching: "The culmination of devotion is inviting the complete divine family to permanently dwell in your heart, making your very being a sacred temple."
  when_to_use: "Recite this closing doha as the final prayer after completing the Chalisa, inviting divine presence to permanently reside within you."
