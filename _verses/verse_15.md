literal_translation: "Yama, Kubera, the guardians of directions - from where can poets and scholars even begin to describe your glory?"

interpretive_meaning: "This verse uses rhetorical impossibility - even if all the gods, poets, and scholars tried, they couldn't fully describe Hanuman's glory. It establishes Hanuman as beyond complete comprehension, teaching humility in our attempts to understand the divine. The verse also shows that worldly learning has limits before divine mystery."

story: "Yama (death), Kubera (wealth), and the Digpalas (directional guardians) represent cosmic order and power. Even they acknowledge their limitations in praising Hanuman. This teaching appears in various scriptures - the divine is always greater than our capacity to describe it. Hanuman's glories are sung but never exhausted."

practical_application:
  teaching: "Divine glory is infinite and beyond complete description - our attempts to praise and understand should be offered with humility."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when you need to cultivate humility before the divine mystery, or when you recognize the limitations of words and intellect."
