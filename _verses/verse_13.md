literal_translation: ""Even the thousand-mouthed serpent (Shesha) sings your glories," saying thus, the Lord embraced you."

interpretive_meaning: "Shesha, the cosmic serpent on whom Vishnu rests, has a thousand heads constantly singing divine glories. If even Shesha sings Hanuman's praises, it indicates Hanuman's glory is cosmic and eternal. Rama's embrace following this statement shows divine recognition of Hanuman's supreme devotion."

story: "Shesha Naga is considered the king of all nagas and represents infinity. He chants the names of Vishnu eternally. For Rama (an avatar of Vishnu) to say that even Shesha sings Hanuman's glories indicates that Hanuman's devotion is acknowledged in all realms and across all time. This verse is often cited to show that devotees can become as celebrated as the divine."

practical_application:
  teaching: "True devotion elevates the devotee to cosmic significance, earning eternal praise across all realms of existence."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when you need to remember that sincere devotion transcends time and space, earning recognition even in the highest divine realms."
