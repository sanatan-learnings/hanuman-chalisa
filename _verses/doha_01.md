literal_translation: "With the dust of my Guru's lotus feet, I cleanse the mirror of my mind and describe the pure glory of Raghubar (Lord Rama), which grants the four fruits."

interpretive_meaning: "Tulsidas begins by paying homage to his spiritual teacher, acknowledging that divine wisdom comes through the guru's grace. By purifying the mind (like cleaning a mirror), one can truly perceive and describe the divine glory. The four fruits refer to Dharma (righteousness), Artha (wealth), Kama (desires), and Moksha (liberation)."

story: "Tulsidas was a devotee who transformed from a worldly person to a saint through his guru's guidance. This verse reflects the Indian tradition of \"guru vandana\" (salutation to the teacher) before beginning any sacred work, acknowledging that all knowledge flows from the guru to the disciple."

practical_application:
  teaching: "True knowledge and spiritual progress comes through the grace of the guru and a purified mind."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse at the beginning of any sacred work, study, or spiritual practice to invoke the guru's blessings and prepare your mind to receive divine wisdom."
