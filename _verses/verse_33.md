story: "Hanuman is considered the easiest path to Rama - his accessibility and responsiveness make him approachable for common devotees. The concept is that Hanuman, being Rama's greatest devotee, naturally leads his devotees to Rama. Breaking the cycle of birth and death (samsara) is the ultimate spiritual goal, achievable through this devotional path."
