interpretive_meaning: "\"Bajrangi\" refers to Hanuman's indestructible body, blessed by Indra with the strength of Vajra (thunderbolt). Beyond physical strength, this verse highlights Hanuman's role as a spiritual purifier - he removes negative tendencies (kumati) and nurtures positive wisdom (sumati) in devotees."

story: "As a child, Hanuman was struck by Indra's thunderbolt when he tried to swallow the sun. Instead of being harmed, his jaw became strong (Hanu = jaw, Man = disfigured), giving him his name. Indra blessed him with invincibility. This incident demonstrates that obstacles often lead to greater blessings."

  teaching: "True strength includes both physical courage and mental purity - removing negative thoughts and cultivating positive wisdom."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when struggling with negative thoughts, doubts, or mental obstacles, or when you need courage and clarity of mind."
