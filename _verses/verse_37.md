A guru doesn't just give gifts; he guides transformation. This verse asks not just for Hanuman's protection but for his guidance toward spiritual evolution."

Asking for his grace "like a guru" means requesting not just material help but spiritual wisdom, discipline, and guidance toward self-realization."

  teaching: "Seek Hanuman's grace not just for solving problems but for spiritual guidance and transformation, like a divine guru."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when you need spiritual guidance, wisdom, and transformation - not just material help but deep inner growth."
