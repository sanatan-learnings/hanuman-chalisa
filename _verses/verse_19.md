literal_translation: "Placing the Lord's ring in your mouth, you crossed the ocean - this is no surprise."

interpretive_meaning: "The ring symbolizes Rama's blessing and identity. With divine grace (represented by the ring), any impossible task becomes possible. "Acharaj nahin" (no surprise) indicates that for a true devotee carrying the Lord's grace, miracles are natural. Faith makes the impossible possible."

story: "Before Hanuman leaped to Lanka to find Sita, Rama gave him his ring as a token of identity so Sita would trust him. Hanuman kept it in his mouth while crossing the hundred-yojana ocean in a single leap. The ring represented Rama's presence and blessing. This teaches that when we undertake difficult tasks for divine purposes, we carry divine grace with us."

practical_application:
  teaching: "When we carry divine grace and act with faith in service of a higher purpose, seemingly impossible obstacles become naturally surmountable."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when facing a daunting challenge in service of a righteous cause, to remember that divine grace makes miracles natural."
