literal_translation: "You brought the Sanjeevani herb and revived Lakshmana; Rama joyfully embraced you to his chest."

interpretive_meaning: "This verse captures one of the most celebrated acts in the Ramayana. Hanuman's determination to save Lakshmana by bringing the entire mountain (when he couldn't identify the herb) shows his commitment. Rama's embrace represents divine acknowledgment that pure devotion and effort matter more than perfect execution."

story: "When Lakshmana was struck by Indrajit's weapon and lay dying, the vaidya (physician) said only the Sanjeevani herb from Dronagiri mountain could save him before dawn. Hanuman flew to the mountain but couldn't identify which herb was Sanjeevani. Rather than return empty-handed or waste time guessing, he uprooted the entire mountain and brought it back. This decisive action saved Lakshmana's life and exemplifies problem-solving through dedication."

practical_application:
  teaching: "When facing impossible deadlines or difficult choices, decisive action driven by devotion matters more than perfect knowledge."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when facing urgent challenges where you must act despite uncertainty, or when you need the courage to go beyond conventional solutions."
