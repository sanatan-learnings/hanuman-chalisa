literal_translation: "Tulsidas is always a servant of Hari; O Lord, make your dwelling in my heart."

interpretive_meaning: "Tulsidas identifies himself as "Hari chera" (servant of Hari/Rama), showing humility despite being a great saint and poet. The request for Hanuman to dwell in his heart represents the ultimate spiritual goal - divine presence residing permanently within. This is not just an external deity to worship but an internal, constant presence."

story: "Tulsidas wrote the Ramcharitmanas and Hanuman Chalisa as expressions of his intense devotion. Despite being a learned Brahmin, he called himself merely a servant. This final verse is his personal prayer, yet by including it in the Chalisa, he invites all reciters to make the same prayer - that Hanuman (and through him, Rama) may dwell in their hearts permanently."

practical_application:
  teaching: "The ultimate goal of devotion is not external worship but inviting the divine to dwell permanently within your heart."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse as your personal prayer, asking Hanuman to make his permanent dwelling in your heart, transforming you from within."
