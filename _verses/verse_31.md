literal_translation: "Mother Sita gave you the boon of being the giver of the eight siddhis and nine nidhis."

interpretive_meaning: "The eight siddhis are supernatural powers (like becoming tiny, huge, light, heavy, obtaining anything, etc.). The nine nidhis are great treasures. Despite having these powers himself, Hanuman can grant them to others. Sita's blessing shows divine feminine grace. The verse teaches that Hanuman is not just powerful but can empower others."

story: "When Hanuman met Sita in Ashoka Vatika, he delivered Rama's message and offered to carry her back. Sita refused (as she wanted Rama himself to rescue her) but blessed Hanuman, granting him the power to bestow both spiritual powers and material prosperity on his devotees. This blessing makes Hanuman unique among deities - he can grant both worldly success and spiritual attainment."

practical_application:
  teaching: "Hanuman's blessings encompass both spiritual powers and material prosperity - devotees can seek comprehensive fulfillment through his grace."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when seeking both spiritual growth and material well-being, remembering that Hanuman can bless you with comprehensive success."
