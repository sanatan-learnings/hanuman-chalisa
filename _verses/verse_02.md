literal_translation: "You are Rama's messenger, repository of incomparable strength. You are known as the son of Anjani and the son of the wind."

interpretive_meaning: "Being Rama's messenger (doot) is Hanuman's most cherished identity - his entire existence is devoted to serving Rama. His incomparable strength isn't for personal glory but for divine service. His dual parentage (Anjani as mother and Vayu as spiritual father) signifies both earthly and divine origins."

story: "Hanuman's birth itself was miraculous. Anjana, a celestial nymph cursed to be born as a monkey, prayed for a divine child. Vayu (wind god) played a role in his birth, giving Hanuman the speed and power of wind. His identity as \"Ram Doot\" was cemented when he crossed the ocean to find Sita in Lanka."

practical_application:
  teaching: "True strength is found in selfless service to a higher purpose, not in personal achievement or glory."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when you need to remember your purpose in serving others or a higher cause, or when you need incomparable strength to fulfill an important duty."
