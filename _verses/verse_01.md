This establishes Hanuman as both learned and universally revered."

  teaching: "True greatness combines knowledge and virtues, and divine wisdom illuminates all aspects of life without discrimination."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when seeking wisdom and enlightenment, or when you need to remember that learning and virtuous qualities are limitless like the ocean."
