interpretive_meaning: ""Rasiya" indicates Hanuman's deep aesthetic and emotional appreciation for divine narratives - he doesn't just serve mechanically but finds joy in hearing about Rama. The three divine beings residing in his heart shows complete mental and emotional absorption in the divine, with no room for ego or worldly desires."

story: "Hanuman would often sit for hours listening to anyone narrate Rama's stories, tears of devotion flowing from his eyes. When asked about his devotion, Hanuman tore open his chest to reveal Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana seated in his heart - a literal demonstration of how they resided within him. This is one of the most famous images in Hindu iconography."

  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when you want to deepen your devotional connection, or when you need to remember that the divine can dwell within your own heart."
