story: "According to mythology, Shiva took birth as Hanuman to serve Rama (an avatar of Vishnu), demonstrating the unity of all divine forms. Kesari was a brave monkey king, and Hanuman inherited courage from him. Despite his power, Hanuman remained humble, which made him even more worthy of worship."

  teaching: "True greatness combines divine connection, inherited virtues, and personal humility - together they earn universal respect."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when you need to connect with your divine nature and remember that humility amplifies true glory."
