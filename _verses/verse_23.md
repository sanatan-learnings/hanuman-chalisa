literal_translation: "You alone can control your own power; the three worlds tremble at your roar."

interpretive_meaning: "This verse describes Hanuman's immense power while highlighting his self-control. Only he can restrain his own might - no external force can contain it. Yet he voluntarily controls himself, using power only for righteous purposes. This teaches that true strength includes self-restraint and that power without control is dangerous."

story: "When Hanuman roared in Lanka after setting it ablaze, the entire kingdom shook. When he roared before entering battle, demons fled in terror. Yet this same Hanuman could be gentle as a lamb before Sita and humble before Rama. The verse emphasizes that he possessed the rarest combination - unlimited power with complete control, used only in service of dharma."

practical_application:
  teaching: "True power lies not just in strength but in the self-control to use that strength only for righteous purposes."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when you need to cultivate self-control over your own power, anger, or abilities, ensuring they serve dharma."
