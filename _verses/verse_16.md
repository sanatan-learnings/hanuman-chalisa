literal_translation: "You did a great favor to Sugriva by uniting him with Rama and helping him obtain his kingdom."

interpretive_meaning: "This verse shows Hanuman as a bridge-builder and helper. He didn't just serve Rama; he helped others too. By connecting Sugriva with Rama, he created a mutually beneficial relationship - Sugriva got his kingdom back, and Rama got an army to rescue Sita. This teaches that true service means creating connections that benefit all."

story: "Sugriva was living in exile on Rishyamukh mountain, having been driven away by his brother Vali who also took his wife. When Hanuman first met Rama and Lakshmana, he recognized their divine nature and brought them to Sugriva. Rama killed Vali (who had been oppressing Sugriva unjustly), and Sugriva regained his kingdom of Kishkindha. In return, Sugriva's vast monkey army helped Rama in his quest to rescue Sita."

practical_application:
  teaching: "True service means creating connections and helping others in ways that benefit all parties and serve the greater good."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when you need wisdom to bring people together for mutual benefit, or when you have the opportunity to help someone regain what they've lost."
