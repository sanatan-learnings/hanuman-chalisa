The contrast between "durgam" (impossible) and "sugam" (easy) shows the transformative power of divine grace. This verse is often recited when facing challenges."

story: "Throughout the Ramayana, Hanuman accomplished tasks others deemed impossible - crossing the ocean, finding Sita in vast Lanka, bringing the Sanjeevani mountain, etc. His approach combined faith, intelligence, and effort. This verse reflects the experience of countless devotees who have felt difficulties dissolve when they sincerely invoke Hanuman's help."

practical_application:
  teaching: "Divine grace transforms impossible challenges into manageable tasks - invoke Hanuman's blessings when facing difficulties."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when confronting seemingly impossible tasks or overwhelming challenges, to invoke Hanuman's grace to make them surmountable."
